<h1>Special Characters</h1>
<!-- content starts below here -->
<p>Since <,>, and & have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &lt; to represent it.
